1.0.0
-----

Extensive refactoring by @juanjoDiaz:
- Series of modular classes
- Different lemmatization strategies available
- Customization of dictionary loading and handling (`DictionaryFactory`)
- `LanguageDetector` class with extended options
- See readme and [detailed documentation](https://adbar.github.io/simplemma/)

Breaking changes:
- The `extensive` argument is now `greedy`
- The `langdetect` submodule is now `language_detector`
`from simplemma.langdetect import ...` → `from simplemma.language_detector import ...`

Fixes and improvements:
- `is_known()` function now restored to its state in v0.9.0 (full dictionary)
- More languages and better rules (with @juanjoDiaz)
- Use binary strings in dictionaries to save memory
- Dictionary sort before compression by @1over137

Documentation:
- Classes and general doc pages by @juanjoDiaz 
- Section on classes in the readme by @osma


0.9.1
-----

* smaller language data footprint with smallest possible impact on performance, using a combination of rules, upper limit on word length, and better data cleaning (#31)
* unsupervised approach to affixes activated by default for some languages
* reviewed rules for English and German (less greedy)
* added rules for Dutch, Finnish, Polish and Russian
* improved Russian and Ukrainian language data (#3)
* improved tokenizer


0.9.0
-----

* smaller data files (especially for fi, la, pl, pt, sk & tr, #19)
* added support for Asturian (``ast``, #20)
* bug fixes (#18, #26)


0.8.2
-----

* languages added: Albanian, Hindi, Icelandic, Malay, Middle English, Northern Sámi, Nynorsk, Serbo-Croatian, Swahili, Tagalog

0.7.0
-----

* **breaking change**: language data pre-loading now occurs internally, language codes are now directly provided in ``lemmatize()`` call, e.g. ``simplemma.lemmatize("test", lang="en")``
